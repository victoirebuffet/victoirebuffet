- 👋 Hi, I’m Victoire Buffet, a master's student in climate sciences. 
- 👀 I’m interested in climate variability at different scales, climate change, atmospheric dynamics and extreme events such as atmospheric rivers. I'm also interested in developing deep learning tools for more efficient methods.
- 🌱 I'm learning to code better and I'm sure the creation of this github will push me to write clearer and better structured scripts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on climate scripts, or even other fun data processing challenges, to sharpen my skills.
